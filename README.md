[Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is very efficient **Time Management** method.

This application helps you to track your time according to _Pomodoro Technique_. It has the functionalities as follows:

* Pomodoros can be given
* Every pomodoro divided by 5 min break
* Minutes of your Pomodoro can be selected with a Slide Bar
* The window can be closed and the pomodoro can be tracked from Status Bar
